/*
Excuse the bad practices (massive headers, using namespace). They are for a faster coding.

When submitting the program, define DEBUG 0. When debugging, define DEBUG 1. In the program, for debugging information, use if (DEBUG){...} such that when it is submitted we don't have that code there.

Use this code to immediately terminate if the time is too much to handle: if (clock() > 0.95 * CLOCKS_PER_SEC) break;

Use the contest logger we made to log the contest.

Backup this program every so often in the Backup.txt files in case something goes wrong later.
