Sun Nov 17 00:19:23 2013 > With such a developed environment, I must be able to program effectively.
Sun Nov 17 00:19:35 2013 > Tomorrow will be the November 2013 contest.
Sun Nov 17 00:19:44 2013 > I must get ready, and thus I am up late tonight to study.
Sun Nov 17 00:19:57 2013 > I'm not sure if it is the right thing to do, but I have been inspired.
Sun Nov 17 00:20:04 2013 > Inspiration, after all, is very important.
Sun Nov 17 00:20:29 2013 > Well, there is not time limit for practice. But for now, I will do the Silver of last year's November contest, and see how well I do.
Sun Nov 17 00:21:07 2013 > Now, I am starting #1, and time me please.
Sun Nov 17 00:27:48 2013 > I seem to know #1 now, so I will start to program it.
Sun Nov 17 00:31:31 2013 > Programming done, debugging.
Sun Nov 17 00:33:51 2013 > Seems to be all correct. Wow, I'm impressed
Sun Nov 17 00:33:57 2013 > That only took 12 minutes.
Sun Nov 17 00:37:36 2013 > Starting #2
Sun Nov 17 00:44:42 2013 > OK, I will start programming.
Sun Nov 17 00:51:17 2013 > I've stumbled upon some trouble programming, revising algorithm.
Sun Nov 17 00:56:40 2013 > Will continue on with original algorithm.
Sun Nov 17 01:11:13 2013 > I've been debugging for some while.
Sun Nov 17 01:12:28 2013 > Well, let's submit it, I've found the problem to the program.
Sun Nov 17 01:14:03 2013 > Looks like I got many test cases wrong. I wonder why.
Sun Nov 17 01:14:46 2013 > I think I set some limits too low.
Sun Nov 17 01:16:01 2013 > Yes, that was the problem. I'm sure that in competition I would have noticed this before final submission.
Sun Nov 17 01:16:21 2013 > So this problem took a bit longer, around 45 minutes. 
Sun Nov 17 01:16:22 2013 > Wow.
Sun Nov 17 01:19:21 2013 > I read the solution. They optimized it even more than I did, but I think it is unneccessary.
Sun Nov 17 01:19:25 2013 > It will just waste time.
Sun Nov 17 01:19:41 2013 > I seem to be on a roll, but I must sleep sometime. And that shall be now.
Sun Nov 17 01:19:55 2013 > Then let us conclude our night rush here. Twas interesting.
