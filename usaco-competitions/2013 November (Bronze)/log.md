Mon Nov 18 15:46:29 2013 > I accidentally deleted my contest log for the Silver level.
Mon Nov 18 15:46:33 2013 > But that's not important.
Mon Nov 18 15:46:48 2013 > I've created another account, and this time I will participate in the bronze division.
Mon Nov 18 15:47:19 2013 > I guess I can start anytime.
Mon Nov 18 15:47:24 2013 > We'll start in 15.
Mon Nov 18 15:47:38 2013 > Go!
Mon Nov 18 15:51:46 2013 > Still thinking about #1.
Mon Nov 18 15:56:49 2013 > I guess we can just brute force this problem.
Mon Nov 18 16:09:38 2013 > It seems to work, but also too easy, though it is bronze. Submitting and moving on...
Mon Nov 18 16:12:46 2013 > So #2 is more than just brute force.
Mon Nov 18 16:20:22 2013 > I seem to be having trouble thinking of an algorithm for #2.
Mon Nov 18 16:26:25 2013 > I have found a fast-enough algorithm. Figuring out the specifics...
Mon Nov 18 16:27:55 2013 > Starting to program.
Mon Nov 18 16:44:42 2013 > Still programming...
Mon Nov 18 16:50:56 2013 > The program seems to work, but I'm too lazy to check it. Submitting...
Mon Nov 18 16:52:03 2013 > Maybe I'll check later. Moving on...
Mon Nov 18 16:53:48 2013 > Well, #3 is the same as #1 of the silver. I guess I'm done then. LOL.
Mon Nov 18 17:02:23 2013 > I've disguised my program, so that they probably can't tell it's the same person.
Mon Nov 18 17:03:00 2013 > Now I will just continue the disguising task.
Mon Nov 18 17:07:51 2013 > Hopefully they don't catch me, because they do have submission records. The IP is different, the header is different (for the final submissions), and many things are different.
Mon Nov 18 17:08:52 2013 > Well, that concludes my experience. Have fun.
