Sun Jan 12 16:58:44 2014 > So I'll be starting sometime soon, within the next hour. I have xKito running. All I have to do is to do my best, that is all. And not screw up my eyes.
Sun Jan 12 17:00:59 2014 > I'm only going to limit this to contest developments, not like The Journal.
Sun Jan 12 17:31:19 2014 > I guess I should start if I'm going to do anything.
Sun Jan 12 17:31:25 2014 > 5
Sun Jan 12 17:31:48 2014 > Well internet is slow.
Sun Jan 12 17:33:40 2014 > OK, 2 minutes in, a bit of lag on the internet, now fixed. Reading #1.
Sun Jan 12 17:38:25 2014 > #1 is probably a convex hull problem. Need to look up algorithm for convex hull.
Sun Jan 12 17:46:27 2014 > #1 is somehwat complicated, being computational geometry, but I think we can do it. I have a general algorithm in mind, be it susceptible to bugs.
Sun Jan 12 17:48:11 2014 > I guess we should explore other options/problems before going all in on #1.
Sun Jan 12 17:55:19 2014 > Well I don't have an immediate thought on #2. Think about it a little more...
Sun Jan 12 17:57:07 2014 > I will look at #3 first.
Sun Jan 12 17:59:59 2014 > Both 2 and 3 are quite unconventional, I will proceed with #1. Convex hull and polygon testing.
Sun Jan 12 18:13:45 2014 > Convex hull algorithm is working. I now have to write from scratch the determin if point is in polygon algorithm.
Sun Jan 12 18:46:24 2014 > I have finished the program for #1. It's OK I guess. It's one that I can debug and be sure to get right.
Sun Jan 12 18:49:01 2014 > Debugging #1.
Sun Jan 12 18:53:38 2014 > I guess I don't have time anymore. I've submitted #1, going to look at #2 again.
Sun Jan 12 19:14:02 2014 > I'm not sure about either of the problems
Sun Jan 12 19:14:16 2014 > I've wasted quite a bit of time thinking, but I seriously cannot figure out an algorithm for any.
Sun Jan 12 19:18:36 2014 > I'll look at #3, it seems to have some hope.
Sun Jan 12 19:25:01 2014 > I have an algorithm for #3! Thinking more on it.
Sun Jan 12 19:29:28 2014 > By the looks of it, I'll be implementing a full program for #3, and a substitute one for #2, which shouldn't actually work too bad. Hopefully this goes well. 2 hours left.
Sun Jan 12 19:30:51 2014 > For #3, I'll be keeping a vector of updated difficulties to each panel to solve the problem.
Sun Jan 12 20:13:05 2014 > OK, finished #3, test case works, need to rest before debugging #3 and BSing #2.
Sun Jan 12 20:18:07 2014 > OK, I'm back to debug #3 for major bugs, and not algorithmic changes. I'm not too sure about time limits on #3, but hopefully it will pass. I used vectors, so it might not be as fast as predicted. After debugging and submitting, I'll write a simple program for #2 which should do most of the test cases correctly.
Sun Jan 12 20:23:39 2014 > So if I have 1500 starting points my program fails.
Sun Jan 12 20:24:40 2014 > There is no limit on the number of starting points, so my program is at great risk. Have mercy, test data. 
Sun Jan 12 20:26:09 2014 > Well, I don't see how I can modify my program to go faster, but I will see about the code bugs themselves before moving on to #1, and then to #2 (changed).
Sun Jan 12 20:28:14 2014 > I think that if it works for the test case, there are no programmatical bugs for #3. Well, that is as far as my algorithm will go, time will judge itself. Moving to #1 for debugging.
Sun Jan 12 20:36:00 2014 > I found a subtle programmatical error in #1, but I doubt it will change too much. Anyway, resubmitting #1, and then working on #2.
Sun Jan 12 20:38:03 2014 > Working on #2.
Sun Jan 12 21:02:16 2014 > I've finished with a simple #2 program which will run in time, but not always produce the right output.
Sun Jan 12 21:02:24 2014 > Debugging it, and after, we'll be done.
Sun Jan 12 21:14:14 2014 > I've finished #2. It probably won't score too many points, but every point is valuable.
Sun Jan 12 21:14:23 2014 > Until next time!
