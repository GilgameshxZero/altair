Sun Dec 15 10:27:19 2013 > This is 2013 December
Sun Dec 15 10:27:45 2013 > I'm in the Gold division this time. I don't think my knowledge is enough to get me a good score, but I will nonetheless try my best
Sun Dec 15 10:28:12 2013 > I have xKito's 5 hour music running, and will start when there are exactly 4 hours left.
Sun Dec 15 10:28:21 2013 > Hopefully I'll be able to save my log this time.
Sun Dec 15 10:29:16 2013 > Basically I have around 5 minutes, but I guess I can start early (according to the mix).
Sun Dec 15 10:32:45 2013 > These logs are all part of the Journal, so if you have questions about my references, you should see The Journal.
Sun Dec 15 10:33:12 2013 > Because I have nothing to do, I'll start on the 30th second.
Sun Dec 15 10:33:33 2013 > Go!
Sun Dec 15 10:40:04 2013 > Not sure what we need to know the hubs for.
Sun Dec 15 10:50:21 2013 > Hmm, still thinking about #1. I guess I'll move on to #2 for now.
Sun Dec 15 11:05:23 2013 > OK, I have a DP solution for #2, which is probably the right solution, it's just that some parts of my DP I'm not so confident about, but I am about the main DP loop.
Sun Dec 15 11:05:48 2013 > I guess I'll take a look at #3, before I decide on which problem to go with first.
Sun Dec 15 11:16:22 2013 > Going for a break.
Sun Dec 15 11:18:36 2013 > I guess I'll start programming #2, while thinking of ways to resolve the DP problem.
Sun Dec 15 11:21:52 2013 > I guess we'll just DP it out, and optimize like crazy.
Sun Dec 15 11:44:15 2013 > My DP seems to be doing well, after running a few big test cases. I guess I'll submit #2 now, and hopefully it can score near full points.
Sun Dec 15 11:44:52 2013 > Break time!
Sun Dec 15 11:48:54 2013 > And I'm back. I'm gonna meddle on #2 for bugs and test cases for a while, before moving on.
Sun Dec 15 11:59:38 2013 > OK, moving on. Our program can't handle the largest test case, but it can handle almost all of the smaller ones.
Sun Dec 15 12:00:28 2013 > I guess I'm back on #1. for now.
Sun Dec 15 12:24:39 2013 > OK, need to focus.
Sun Dec 15 12:30:35 2013 > Thinking for an algorithm for #3 now. If I cannot find one, I can go for the 50% score on that problem with a brute-force algorithm, which is good enough for my tastes.
Sun Dec 15 12:32:20 2013 > OK, I have a pretty good thourhg for #3. Need to develop it further.
Sun Dec 15 12:40:53 2013 > Because I might be able to solve #3 completely, we should work on #1 now, and develop a partial solution, before continuing with #3.
Sun Dec 15 12:47:54 2013 > I've thought of a solution that should be fast enough for #1, which I will start implementing now, as I only have 105 minutes left.
Sun Dec 15 13:21:46 2013 > Still programming #1. I'm almost done, but there might be a few bugs, so I might have to do a brute-force for #3, if I even have time.
Sun Dec 15 13:43:10 2013 > Yep, there are bugs in #1. Well, I guess I'm stuck to debug them until it works satisfactorally.
Sun Dec 15 13:54:17 2013 > Well I've finished debugging the test case. I'm not sure how it will perform with other more complicated cases, because as it seems now, the program is pretty slow, so I don't think it will work well.
Sun Dec 15 13:57:19 2013 > OK, so apparently its the memory cleanup that takes a lot of time.
Sun Dec 15 13:57:33 2013 > Let me stay on #1 for a bit more time, to fix up some final bugs and such.
Sun Dec 15 13:59:24 2013 > Yep, it's definitely fast enough. I just need to verify the algorithm, because if it is not right, then all that work would have been a waste.
Sun Dec 15 14:00:05 2013 > Give me 3 more minutes to save 30 mins for #3.
Sun Dec 15 14:04:48 2013 > I can say no more for #1. I will not spend the time for test cases, but instead move directly onto #3, which I most likely will be doing a brute-force for.
Sun Dec 15 14:05:37 2013 > OK, I really need a break, before I program the fastest I have ever before.
Sun Dec 15 14:07:15 2013 > OK, let's brute-force #3.
Sun Dec 15 14:09:25 2013 > I'm not even sure if I can get this in time, but we have to try don't we?
Sun Dec 15 14:24:26 2013 > OK, I've finished my brute-force solution for #3, and just in time. Submitting now, and I guess this is why you plan your time.
Sun Dec 15 14:25:22 2013 > So I have 8 minutes left. I'm going to look at #3 for a while more, just debugging, and we'll be done soon.
Sun Dec 15 14:26:02 2013 > OK, going for a break.
Sun Dec 15 14:30:12 2013 > With 4 minutes left in the competition, I shall end our log here. Our music mix has ended with ~50 minutes left, probably due to breaks. Well, hopefully our score is good.
