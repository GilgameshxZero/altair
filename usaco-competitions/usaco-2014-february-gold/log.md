Sun Feb 09 16:05:49 2014 > So I realize we are starting a bit late.
Sun Feb 09 16:06:01 2014 > That isn't a problem. Confidence and adaptibility are important.
Sun Feb 09 16:06:17 2014 > I have October Chillstep from XK running, hopefully it will help for the first hour.
Sun Feb 09 16:06:25 2014 > Will need something for sustain though, but we will see.
Sun Feb 09 16:06:29 2014 > Let's go!
Sun Feb 09 16:06:33 2014 > On the minutes that is.
Sun Feb 09 16:06:57 2014 > Start!
Sun Feb 09 16:18:57 2014 > We could use Dijkstra's multiple times (<=250 times) for #1, which is like O (21M), which is probably not fast enough. IDK, will look at #2 now.
Sun Feb 09 16:29:48 2014 > #2's limits are quite low... and the clarification is quite specific...
Sun Feb 09 16:37:33 2014 > I'm definitely having trouble thinking about #2... maybe it's DP. Moving on..
Sun Feb 09 17:04:06 2014 > I guess I was led a bit off track. That's really bad
Sun Feb 09 17:04:12 2014 > Whatever, I still have 3 hours.
Sun Feb 09 17:04:30 2014 > I will start programming at 3 hours, will use remaining time to think about #3.
Sun Feb 09 17:06:00 2014 > I have a rough algorithm for #3, but I start with #1 for now.
Sun Feb 09 17:55:37 2014 > I've finished the program for #1, and debugged it roughly. I need to move on to the next problem soon too.
Sun Feb 09 17:56:21 2014 > It's not as efficient as I thought it would be, but I expect at least a 70% turnout on this problem.
Sun Feb 09 18:01:10 2014 > Hopefully I didn't do anything wrong. I will do final checks on #1, then turn to #3.
Sun Feb 09 18:04:46 2014 > OK, moving on to #3.
Sun Feb 09 18:15:15 2014 > I have an algorithm for #3, checking runtime.
Sun Feb 09 18:15:43 2014 > I'm really not sure about runtime, but it'll have to do. We could use LinkedList if needed.
Sun Feb 09 18:15:48 2014 > Let's start programming #3.
Sun Feb 09 19:11:23 2014 > I've tried very hard to program #3, but I can't do it.
Sun Feb 09 19:11:48 2014 > I guess I'll go with a simple solution on #3, probably gonna get 3 test cases right.
Sun Feb 09 19:41:34 2014 > Well I'm done. IDK, I'll just look at the problems and see what more I can do in 30 mins.
Sun Feb 09 19:57:18 2014 > I fixed up #1 a little. It should run faster and have less errors with larger numbers. Hopefully it will help me get a perfect score on #1, which is going to boost my score a lot.
Sun Feb 09 19:57:42 2014 > There is still 10 minutes left. I think I'm done. Well, I tried my best :) That's what matters in the end.
