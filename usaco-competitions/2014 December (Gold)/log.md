Sun Dec 14 08:22:08 2014 > I'll be doing the 2014 December USACO contest this time, in Gold.
Sun Dec 14 08:22:23 2014 > The first contest of this year makes me pretty nervous.
Sun Dec 14 08:22:27 2014 > Wish me luck!
Sun Dec 14 08:26:53 2014 > Starting in 10 secs
Sun Dec 14 08:27:00 2014 > Go!
Sun Dec 14 08:27:16 2014 > I guess I'll read all 3 probs first
Sun Dec 14 08:33:06 2014 > All the problems seems relatively straightforward, I will think a bit more about each of them.
Sun Dec 14 08:44:12 2014 > 3 is confusing...
Sun Dec 14 08:49:55 2014 > So #1 seems to be DP, #2 might be RMQ and segtree, and I'm not quite sure about #3
Sun Dec 14 08:54:54 2014 > I'm pretty sure #2 can be done through RMQ and Fenwick, and I think I'm close to getting #1
Sun Dec 14 08:55:46 2014 > Or no, it has to be dynamic RMQ, so segtree
Sun Dec 14 08:56:20 2014 > Yes, that's #2. I'm going to think more about #1.
Sun Dec 14 08:56:45 2014 > I can hangle a 2^20 factor, but how can I test if it works?
Sun Dec 14 09:02:51 2014 > #1 might incorporate DP too...
Sun Dec 14 09:02:55 2014 > or 2 PQ's
Sun Dec 14 09:03:08 2014 > I'll give myself maximum 90 minutes total to think.
Sun Dec 14 09:09:39 2014 > I believe a greedy will work for #1, but I'm not sure.
Sun Dec 14 09:09:50 2014 > Yes, I believe it does work. Moving on to think about #3...
Sun Dec 14 09:15:56 2014 > I'm getting convex hull trick, but can't see how that applies...
Sun Dec 14 09:30:22 2014 > I think I'm very close to a monotonic queue solution for #3...
Sun Dec 14 09:31:45 2014 > Yes! Monotonic queue and binary search can do #3.
Sun Dec 14 09:31:52 2014 > Alright, I'll start programming #1.
Sun Dec 14 09:47:56 2014 > Seems like my greedy for #1 was wrong... the submission didn't pass.
Sun Dec 14 09:50:20 2014 > Oops, bug...
Sun Dec 14 09:50:46 2014 > Seems like it's working.
Sun Dec 14 09:50:56 2014 > Alright, full points on #1.
Sun Dec 14 09:51:04 2014 > Break, then to #2, which is a bit harder to program.
Sun Dec 14 09:53:37 2014 > OK, onto #2.
Sun Dec 14 10:13:23 2014 > Still have more than half time left, so we are doing well.
Sun Dec 14 10:13:41 2014 > I'm almost done with #2.
Sun Dec 14 10:25:29 2014 > So I have a bug... well it shouldn't be too bad.
Sun Dec 14 10:25:35 2014 > Still have 2 hours.
Sun Dec 14 10:34:54 2014 > This segtree problem is really annoying me... I can't seem to get the segtree right.
Sun Dec 14 10:45:56 2014 > Alright, submitting
Sun Dec 14 10:46:14 2014 > Full score! Break, then #3.
Sun Dec 14 10:51:43 2014 > K, back to #3. Hopefully my greedy algorithm for this one will work.
Sun Dec 14 10:59:19 2014 > Hmm, that was easy. Submitting...
Sun Dec 14 10:59:53 2014 > Alright, full score!
Sun Dec 14 10:59:59 2014 > So that's my first 1000.
Sun Dec 14 11:00:40 2014 > Guess that concludes it for me, with more than 80 minutes remaining.
Sun Dec 14 11:07:06 2014 > A few people on CF seem to think the same thing, that this time's USACO is pretty easy. Well, I'm out. Until next time!
