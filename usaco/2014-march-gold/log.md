Sun Mar 09 14:01:52 2014 > I have not prepared well, but I will probably never prepare well.
Sun Mar 09 14:02:03 2014 > THe most important part about contests are mindsets and focus.
Sun Mar 09 14:03:08 2014 > I need to adjust my mindset. Perhaps I will never make it to the training camp. Perhaps I will never make it to MOP, not even the JMO. But as long as I do my best, I will be happy.
Sun Mar 09 14:03:37 2014 > But I know, that as long as I start to do my best from every moment onward, I can reach my full potential. That is the mindset I must learn.
Sun Mar 09 14:04:12 2014 > To focus on doing one's best, and not to reach a goal in mind. For if one can do his best, then he will be able to reach any goal he puts in his mind. That is what I need to do.
Sun Mar 09 14:04:32 2014 > So for this March competition, here goes.
Sun Mar 09 14:04:50 2014 > I will start on 2:06
Sun Mar 09 14:07:38 2014 > OK, or not. I will wait until 2:10, to adjust my mindset and thus strategy.
Sun Mar 09 14:09:26 2014 > I think electricity will be good for this contest, so I'll start up XK. I might need to pause it for analyzing algorithms though.
Sun Mar 09 14:09:46 2014 > I have half a minute. Hopefully I will not get distracted this time.
Sun Mar 09 14:10:03 2014 > Start!
Sun Mar 09 14:14:06 2014 > #1 might be done with approximate searches. I don't know though.
Sun Mar 09 14:16:53 2014 > We could do #2 with prefix sums. It takes N^2 time though.
Sun Mar 09 14:17:09 2014 > DP might be a solution too.
Sun Mar 09 14:22:36 2014 > Hmm, #2 might be the easy one. Moving to #3.
Sun Mar 09 14:24:10 2014 > #3 might be Eulerean Tour.
Sun Mar 09 14:24:47 2014 > The 500 limit for N is quite low too.
Sun Mar 09 14:30:50 2014 > I'm see what I can find on these three problems.
Sun Mar 09 14:31:08 2014 > So for #3 I could probably use the Erdos-Gallai theorem.
Sun Mar 09 14:36:02 2014 > I'm looking more into the theorem. If it's true, then that would be nice.
Sun Mar 09 14:38:28 2014 > OK, well I need to know something about the first two.
Sun Mar 09 14:39:20 2014 > The theorem takes N^2 times, so it will work in time for N=500.
Sun Mar 09 14:43:51 2014 > Well I have a thought for #2 actually and it seems very promising.
Sun Mar 09 14:44:06 2014 > Not just some random theorem, though I do have a lot of confidence in #3.
Sun Mar 09 14:45:20 2014 > We find all the maxima of the set of machines when graphed on a plane
Sun Mar 09 14:45:56 2014 > And we can expand from there, because the answer must include one of the maxima.
Sun Mar 09 14:46:15 2014 > OK, I have a large amount of confidence in high scores for #2 and #3. Let's move on to fully analyze #1.
Sun Mar 09 14:47:38 2014 > That's a whole lot of points already though.
Sun Mar 09 14:49:56 2014 > I have an O(N) time solution for #1, but it takes too much memory.
Sun Mar 09 14:53:33 2014 > I have now an O(N^2) time solution for #1, and it works with memory.
Sun Mar 09 14:54:49 2014 > I'm not sure if it will actually finish in time, but it is worth a try.
Sun Mar 09 14:56:31 2014 > Let's start with #3 and the Erdos-Gallai theorem.
Sun Mar 09 15:02:23 2014 > I just realized #3 is actually O(N^3), but that should still work.
Sun Mar 09 15:26:33 2014 > Well I'm done with #3. I really need to debug it though, because that is very important.
Sun Mar 09 15:41:17 2014 > I guess I will need to move on soon. I will hand generate a few more cases for the program and then do a final check before submitting.
Sun Mar 09 15:53:08 2014 > OK, I should not have messed up on #3. I will come back to it later if I have time, but now I'll do a final check and submit.
Sun Mar 09 16:05:18 2014 > OK, I'm back from break and I have found an error in #3, so I corrected that. I will submit now and I really need to move on to #2.
Sun Mar 09 16:07:08 2014 > Yeah, there's a flaw in my algorithm for #2, so I need to rethink that one.
Sun Mar 09 16:33:52 2014 > My algorithm for #2 might still be flawed, but I have no choice but to continue programming it. I'm already halfway through the program, and I can't stop now.
Sun Mar 09 16:56:57 2014 > Well, I've finished debugging #2, and I guess I'll improve the algorithm a bit to cover the flaw. That should help my score. I really hope it will pass in time though.
Sun Mar 09 17:03:44 2014 > I've discovered a few potential bugs in #2. I will code them out, and then debug more, then switch to #1.
Sun Mar 09 17:19:46 2014 > I believe I've fixed all bugs in #2.
Sun Mar 09 17:20:02 2014 > I don't have quite enough time for #1 though, I guess I need to finish debuggin #2.
Sun Mar 09 17:28:25 2014 > Well I'm going to attempt #1, now that I'm completely done with #2 and #3. Hopefully #3 can get full marks and #3 can get at least 70%.
Sun Mar 09 17:28:34 2014 > #2, I mean, for 70%.
Sun Mar 09 17:34:15 2014 > Hopefully I can get #1 done. I have a slow but right algorithm.
Sun Mar 09 17:38:07 2014 > OK, I'm deciding on an approx search for #1. Let's go!
Sun Mar 09 17:43:03 2014 > Ah, that won't work so well, will it...
Sun Mar 09 17:50:05 2014 > OK, I have a better algorithm that has less probability of going wrong and is faster. Let's go!
Sun Mar 09 17:52:51 2014 > Shoot I don't have enough time for Tarjan's.
Sun Mar 09 18:10:27 2014 > Well, that's the end.
Sun Mar 09 18:10:47 2014 > I guess I could have done better on #1, because it was bronze... I don't know what that means.
Sun Mar 09 18:11:14 2014 > #3 hopefully gets high points. I want #2 to get at least 70% of points, and hopefully I'll get in the 600s this time.
