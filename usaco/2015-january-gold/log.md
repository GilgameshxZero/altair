Mon Jan 19 09:55:59 2015 > Go!
Mon Jan 19 09:57:28 2015 > DP 1?
Mon Jan 19 10:02:02 2015 > Trying brute-force 1
Mon Jan 19 10:07:07 2015 > No, brute-force is wrong
Mon Jan 19 10:09:41 2015 > Reading 2
Mon Jan 19 10:14:31 2015 > 3 seems like leveled graphs
Mon Jan 19 10:15:26 2015 > merge cycles, then level dp?
Mon Jan 19 10:15:37 2015 > its a dag after cycles merged?
Mon Jan 19 10:19:47 2015 > merge cycles with Tarjan's it seems
Mon Jan 19 10:28:58 2015 > I think I have 3 in the bag
Mon Jan 19 10:54:21 2015 > Having trouble debugging...
Mon Jan 19 11:00:14 2015 > Ah, there's a problem...
Mon Jan 19 11:02:21 2015 > Submitted, let's hope
Mon Jan 19 11:02:56 2015 > Mmm bad results...
Mon Jan 19 11:21:57 2015 > Soon...
Mon Jan 19 11:38:15 2015 > Submitting again...
Mon Jan 19 11:38:17 2015 > Shaky...
Mon Jan 19 11:39:11 2015 > Seems like it's working.
Mon Jan 19 11:39:22 2015 > OK, full score
Mon Jan 19 11:39:27 2015 > Time is running short though
Mon Jan 19 11:39:30 2015 > Taking a short break
Mon Jan 19 11:48:32 2015 > Have a modified DP for 1, starting...
Mon Jan 19 12:01:19 2015 > Submitted...
Mon Jan 19 12:01:28 2015 > It seems too simple to be true
Mon Jan 19 12:01:39 2015 > I haven't htought about 2 yet, so I will do so now
Mon Jan 19 12:03:36 2015 > Seems like it was wrong :(
Mon Jan 19 12:13:13 2015 > #2 seems to be exponential
Mon Jan 19 12:13:18 2015 > I'll keep on working on 1 though
Mon Jan 19 12:20:00 2015 > Submitted again
Mon Jan 19 12:27:41 2015 > Ah, looks like I messed up again. On the other hand, I have an algorithm for 2
Mon Jan 19 12:27:47 2015 > The grading is really slow today...
Mon Jan 19 12:44:03 2015 > Hopefully my algorithm for #2 is right, I'm programming it now after resubmitting 1
Mon Jan 19 12:48:25 2015 > IDK why 1 is timing out
Mon Jan 19 12:48:38 2015 > We'll do 2 first, then speed up 1
Mon Jan 19 12:55:52 2015 > 2 shouldn't have any problems,returning to 1
Mon Jan 19 12:56:18 2015 > it seems to be timing out because of high constant factor
Mon Jan 19 13:01:18 2015 > Ah, 2 timed out on large cases. Looks like I need to use constant time optimization
Mon Jan 19 13:06:05 2015 > We'll try to optimize in this last hour
Mon Jan 19 13:56:31 2015 > OK, well it should be around 900
