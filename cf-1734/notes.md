Demonstration of the principle: start with small examples. Small examples are surprisingly difficult to come up with. Leads to thinking about invariants:

1. Uniform modification on any row/col.
2. Shift of any row/col.

Observe the similarity with invariants on linear algebra matrices. Contextual knowledge could have helped narrow down the invariants here. Once invariant 1 is found, it remains to find a “seed” matrix. Several attempts lead to $a_{ij}=r_i*c_j$. Main observation is that the difference in the left column of a square cannot equal the negative difference of the right column; hence, each column must be an arithmetic progression with different delta.
