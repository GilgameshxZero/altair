Sun Feb 10 15:22:42 2013 > I haven't been studying well for this Silver 2013 February contest, but let's just hope for the best of luck!
Sun Feb 10 15:22:52 2013 > 10 secs
Sun Feb 10 15:23:12 2013 > Reading problems...
Sun Feb 10 15:41:22 2013 > Having problems understanding how #1 works... Trying to read it again.
Sun Feb 10 15:47:08 2013 > Just sent an email to Brian Dean asking for clarification on #1. Moving on to examine #2 and #3, which to start first.
Sun Feb 10 16:19:02 2013 > Can't figure out anything...
Sun Feb 10 17:03:05 2013 > Can't figure out anything still...
Sun Feb 10 17:07:00 2013 > Algorithm found fast enough for #2. Beginning programming immediately.
Sun Feb 10 17:17:16 2013 > Revising algorithm... may become too slow. But we have no time for that now. Only 2 hours left.
Sun Feb 10 17:27:05 2013 > Still programming #2
Sun Feb 10 17:49:49 2013 > Still programming....
Sun Feb 10 18:02:03 2013 > Debugging....
Sun Feb 10 18:06:55 2013 > #2 Submitted. Looking at #3
Sun Feb 10 18:11:44 2013 > Thinking about algorithm for #3...
Sun Feb 10 18:12:49 2013 > Algorithm found... -> programming.
Sun Feb 10 18:28:35 2013 > Looking back at #1. Brian replied.
Sun Feb 10 18:29:32 2013 > #3 might be too slow.
Sun Feb 10 18:33:28 2013 > Updated #2, more wholesome search to not miss anything. Should be getting perfect on that one.
Sun Feb 10 18:38:00 2013 > 45 min left, for 1 last problem. #1. I guess I can't help #3 anymore.
Sun Feb 10 18:39:31 2013 > Augghh, can't figure out #1. Getting close though.
Sun Feb 10 18:53:42 2013 > How do you find the holes? I can't seem to think of a way.
Sun Feb 10 19:21:09 2013 > I'm just going to submit the answer for the sample case. Nothing else. Hopefully I will get at least 1 case.
Sun Feb 10 19:24:04 2013 > Contest end
