Uses the *forbidden jutsu* of vertex splitting. Subproblem consideration failed. Small examples helped a little, but not much. Likely not a great technique on graph problems.

A lot of graph problems can be reduced to flow. With this problem, I realized fast its similarity to flow. It is worthwhile considering each graph problem as a potential flow problem. Unfortunately, the restriction (*forbidden jutsu*) pushed me to consider alternative methods.

Flow algorithms are especially malleable to graph transformations. The set of graph algorithms is finite and each algorithm should lend itself to careful consideration before discarding. Usually, a clever transformation following the invariants in the problem will achieve surprising results.
