## B

This one came together pretty quickly after exploring small examples. Took a bit of a leap of faith w.r.t. to the first small example tried, but essentially involved toggling edges along paths between pairs of odd vertices. The question to ask is:

> When a path is toggled, which vertex parities actually change? Turns out, only the two endpoints of the path.

I suppose I can add another technique to the bag-of-tricks for graphs: path decomposition.
